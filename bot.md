### Workflow for Mapping Free-Format Conversations to REST API Notifications

This workflow uses GitHub Copilot (or a similar AI coding assistant like Microsoft Copilot) to map unstructured human/bot conversations into structured parameters for sending notifications via a REST API service (e.g., a RESTer-like service for POST requests). The output is a JSON object specifying the notification function to invoke (`sendNotification`) and its parameters, including a dynamically deduced template for the notification message based on the conversation. This approach leverages Copilot's natural language understanding and code generation capabilities to parse conversations and generate REST API payloads.

#### Assumptions
- The REST API service accepts POST requests with a JSON payload containing notification details (e.g., recipient, message, channel).
- The conversation contains enough context to deduce the notification's intent, recipients, and content.
- Copilot is integrated into an IDE (e.g., VS Code) or used via its API/extensions for parsing and code generation.
- The notification template is dynamically constructed based on conversation keywords (e.g., urgency, topic, team).

#### Workflow Steps
1. **Capture and Preprocess Conversation**:
   - Collect the conversation as a string (e.g., "Human: Notify the team about the urgent meeting tomorrow. Bot: Which team? Human: DevOps, at 10 AM.").
   - Clean the input by removing irrelevant data (e.g., timestamps, greetings) to focus on actionable content.
   - Use Copilot Chat in the IDE to refine the conversation text interactively if needed.

2. **Prompt Copilot for Intent and Template Deduction**:
   - Feed the conversation into Copilot via a chat prompt or code comment, instructing it to extract the function name (`sendNotification`) and parameters, including a deduced message template.
   - Example Prompt (in Copilot Chat or as a comment):
     ```
     // Parse this conversation to map to a REST API notification call:
     // Conversation: [insert conversation text]
     // Function: sendNotification(recipient, message, channel)
     // Deduce a message template based on conversation (e.g., "Urgent: [event] at [time]").
     // Output as JSON: { "functionName": "sendNotification", "parameters": { "recipient": "DevOps", "message": "Urgent: Meeting at 10 AM tomorrow", "channel": "email" } }
     ```
   - Copilot uses its language model to identify key entities (e.g., team, urgency, event details) and constructs a template (e.g., "Urgent: [event] at [time]"). It suggests defaults (e.g., channel: "email") if unspecified.

3. **Generate and Validate Parameters**:
   - Copilot outputs a JSON object with the function name and parameters.
   - Validate the parameters against the REST API schema (e.g., ensure `recipient` is a valid team, `message` is non-empty, `channel` is supported like "email" or "slack").
   - If ambiguous, Copilot can suggest follow-up questions (e.g., "Which channel: email or Slack?") and reprocess the updated conversation.

4. **Send Notification via REST API**:
   - Use the generated JSON to construct a REST API POST request (e.g., to `/notify` endpoint).
   - Execute the request using a library like `requests` in Python or `fetch` in JavaScript.
   - Log the response or handle errors (e.g., retry on failure).

5. **Handle Multi-Turn Conversations**:
   - For ongoing chats, maintain state using variables or context tracking in Copilot Studio (if integrated).
   - Re-run the workflow on new messages to update parameters or refine the template.

#### Example Implementation (Python with REST API)
Below is a Python script that uses Copilot-generated logic to parse a conversation, deduce a notification template, and send it via a REST API. The script assumes a RESTer-like service at `https://api.rester.example/notify`.

<xaiArtifact artifact_id="6abad62a-9a4f-438d-9ac0-bec86246456a" artifact_version_id="42ba2cad-e867-4798-a7fe-b7dd33fd50d1" title="notify_team.py" contentType="text/python">
import requests
import json

# Simulated REST API endpoint
API_URL = "https://api.rester.example/notify"

# Predefined function to send notification
def sendNotification(recipient, message, channel="email"):
    payload = {"recipient": recipient, "message": message, "channel": channel}
    response = requests.post(API_URL, json=payload)
    return response.json()

functions = {"sendNotification": sendNotification}

# Step 1: Conversation input
conversation = """
Human: Notify the team about the urgent meeting tomorrow.
Bot: Which team?
Human: DevOps, at 10 AM.
"""

# Step 2: Copilot-generated parsing logic (simulated; in IDE, Copilot autocompletes)
def parse_conversation(convo):
    # Copilot-generated: Parse conversation and deduce template
    if "notify" in convo.lower() and "DevOps" in convo:
        template = "Urgent: Meeting at {time} tomorrow"
        return {
            "functionName": "sendNotification",
            "parameters": {
                "recipient": "DevOps",
                "message": template.format(time="10 AM"),
                "channel": "email"  # Default channel
            }
        }
    return None  # Handle other cases or prompt for clarification

# Step 3: Extract and validate
extracted = parse_conversation(conversation)
if not extracted or extracted["functionName"] not in functions:
    raise ValueError("Invalid function or parsing failed")

# Step 4: Invoke the function
result = functions[extracted["functionName"]](**extracted["parameters"])
print(result)  # Output: API response (e.g., {"status": "Notification sent"})
</xaiArtifact>

#### How It Works
- **Conversation Parsing**: The `parse_conversation` function is a placeholder for Copilot-generated code. In practice, you’d write a partial function in your IDE, and Copilot would suggest regex, string matching, or even LLM-based parsing to extract entities like team ("DevOps"), time ("10 AM"), and urgency ("urgent").
- **Template Deduction**: Copilot infers a template like "Urgent: [event] at [time]" based on keywords. For flexibility, you can prompt Copilot to generate multiple templates and pick the best fit.
- **REST API Call**: The `sendNotification` function sends a POST request to the RESTer-like service with the deduced parameters.
- **Extensibility**: For complex cases, integrate with Microsoft Copilot Studio to handle multi-turn dialogs or use GitHub Copilot Workspace for collaborative workflow design.

#### Considerations
- **Accuracy**: Copilot’s parsing depends on prompt quality. Test with diverse conversations to handle edge cases (e.g., vague times like "tomorrow morning").
- **Scalability**: Extend with predefined templates for common notification types (e.g., meetings, alerts) stored in a config file.
- **Error Handling**: Add retries or fallbacks if the API fails. Use Copilot to generate error-handling code.
- **Security**: Ensure the REST API authenticates requests (e.g., via API keys).

If you provide specific API details (e.g., endpoint, payload format) or example conversations, I can refine the script or template further. Let me know if you want to extend this to other languages (e.g., JavaScript) or add specific notification channels like Slack!
